# secret_santa
This is a quick script I put together for setting up secret santa assignments.  It will email each person in the list with a random assignment

This assumes you have the following:
- a Gmail account
- A csv with the following details for everyone participating:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Mailing Address
  - Additional blurbs (optional)
